Other Apps[15/06/2017 – 8:00 AM] The alarm clock buzzed insistently and I reached over to hit the snooze button. [15/06/2017 – 8:00 AM] The alarm clock buzzed insistently and I reached over to hit the snooze button. I wanted to sleep more…My obedient mind sent some consoling thoughts  like : “Today our trip will be starting on 1 pm , we have plenty of time in hand. I don’t take much time to get ready. He won’t take much time either. If I sleep some more my pictures will be great. We have already paid. The driver won’t run away”….I don’t remember when I fell asleep. I woke up hearing the word “Breakfast”. My husband stood beside the bed and shouting -“ The Breakfast buffet will be closing in 30 minutes.. if you want to have breakfast here..Please hurry up”I looked at the clock , It’s already 10 am. I jumped out of the bed , brushed teeth, put on a jacket over my T-shirt and rushed to the buffet hall.The buffet hall was full of guests. Most of them were foreigners. I mean they were not desis. No..I am not a racist. It’s just that no one was eating parathas. I already knew my options will be very less.I ended up eating chicken Hakka Noodles ,croissant and tea.If you are a tea lover from India , probably you will be missing the morning “Ghar ki chai”.Mr. Husband enjoyed chicken sausage and Chicken Fried Rice. “Someone should make him a brand ambassador of Chicken Fried Rice.”We decided to pack our lunch for the trip. As we were not sure whether we will get any good restaurant to eat there. In these situations Mc. Donalds always comes as savior.[12:30 pm] We got a call from reception that our tour driver has arrived. As we reached the hotel lobby, a tall and thin guy with wheatish complexion and jet black hair came forward.“ Hello , Samiah I am Janu” [ wide smile reaching his ears]Mr Husband: Hello…Where is our car?Janu: Parked in distance…And you? [He looked at me]Me: This is Tamali.. You can call me Tam.Janu : Okk.. Samriah and Tamiah will bring my car here..wait..Me and My husband looked at each other and sighed!We started our journey in Janu’s Toyota Qualis. Janu was quite a charming person. He was the ice breaker. He told us at first we are going to King’s Place (Puri Saren Royal Palace).. Ok…by the name I started imagining the royalness of the  temple. Our car was parked in a distant place from the temple. On the way to the temple, we saw a small lake , beautiful garden, Greeneries everywhere . Everything was really beautiful and well maintained.We entered the temple.Janu gave us a brief history about this temple that how Risi Markaneya came to Bali from India to spread Hinduism and established this temple. His knowledge was very limited about the temple and we could not afford a guide. So we followed our very own free guide Wikipedia : Royal Palace Ubud . Few things I noticed in the UBUD Palace :1) There are lots of open space inside the Palace.2) A series of decorated gates inside the compound.3) Almost all the gates are decorated with twin gurdian statues. The sculptures are made of stones.4) There are multiple pavilions like one for chanting vedic mantra , One to offer flowers and food to God. Entrance was prohibited in few of them.5) The tower’s architecture was like Japanese Pagoda style. (One with multiple roofs pattern).6) The temple was decorated with both wooden and stone sculpting. The design was very much ornaments like.[3:30 Pm] : The next destination was sacred Monkey Forest of Ubud. I am scared of monkeys and it was like a “Khatron ka Khiladi” episode for me. Mr Husband was quite excited and was trying to give me courage . But I had no trust on those monkey’s or Mr. Husband’s instincts…So we decided keep everything including our camera and glasses inside the bag.A lady with a stick in her hand guided us through the Monkey Forest. Should I call her a Monkey Trainer or a Monkey Woman or Monkey Forest Guide.. I don’t know but she was a nice lady.The excited monkeys walked along with us looking for food. The lady was threating them with the stick. She introduced us with the “BOSS of THE MONKEY FOREST”. The boss monkey was old and quite big.He was like a great grand pa of all monkeys.All the way I kept thinking if that old guy jumps into my shoulder what will happen. Then we saw the Mother and child monkey which is the cutest thing possible. I believe mothers are the most beautiful creation of God in every human or animals race. We saw a monkey snatched someone’s glasses. Some people were clicking photos with the monkeys. Brave souls! We gathered some courage and clicked few snaps in our mobile. In one pic below, I looked so scared that the monkey is looking way smarter than me.We saw a lot of bats were hanging from a tree. They were ornamented. A guy was showing them to the visitors and they Visitors were clicking pictures with the bats.I thought not to disturb them as these poor animals work whole night and then at morning nap time they have to get clicked by the visitors. Though the guy was insisting us to take a picture with the bats. But we only took pictures from distance.We had our lunch inside the car with Janu’s permission. Janu asked us to hurry up as he didn’t want us to miss the sunset at Tanah Lot Temple. He also told us this is the best temple in Bali and we should not miss this. Janu set some high hopes about Tanah Lot Temple and we were all charged up.[4:45 PM] As we enter the Tanah Lot Temple I was mesmerized with the view. We saw the temple was situated on a huge coral rock with the Bali sea as a backdrop. We came to know, ‘Tanah’ means ‘land’ and ‘Lot’ means ‘sea’, which perfectly made sense as Tanah lot temple was on a rock floating on the sea. As per Balinese Mythology Tanah Lot temple was built to worship “The God of sea” for prosperity and balance of sea and earth. It is also told that , this temple is protected by the holy sea snakes. There were lots of shops at the entrance and also inside the temple. The place was crowded. Janu told us this is the most visited place in Bali. We took few snaps. My camera could not do justice with the beauty of that place , but here are few snaps which will give an idea.
After sometime everyone started walking along the bridge of the temple connecting to other end. People were all set with their cameras and gears. It was the sunset time at Tanah Lot!Sunset at Tanah Lot is once in a lifetime experience for me. The gasping waves were waiting for full tide. As they were crashing beneath the coral rock creating a hypnotic murmuring sound. The sun was almost setting created a bright golden orangish tone in the sky. The uneven rocks were drenched by the white foam like waves as if they were being purified. We were standing on one of the small rocks and witnessed this most spectacular view.I wanted the time to be frozen, I wanted to capture this moment in my mind forever. We clicked few snaps and recorded a short video.

video link : https://youtu.be/-zwMyIWsXJIOn our way back home I was really tired and sleepy. Janu and my husband were planning for tomorrow’s trip. Janu asked for 1,000,000,000 IDR for the trip. Mr. Husband was desperately trying to make him understand that he was putting an extra 0s , that it should be 1000000 IDR. I looked outside through the car’s window,by closing my eyes I tried to absorb the day so far. My mind took me through the journey once again.I fell asleep. I woke up with a loud sound of horn. Janu blew the car’s horn as we reached our hotel. I looked at my Husband.Mr Husband : [Smirking] Good Morning!

Other Apps13/06/2017: We started our day with a huge fight over a silly matter. Last time I was engaged with this type of fight when I was in Class 5, when someone tried to snatch my best friend. Nothing has changed much since then…only our age.  Ah! but age is just a number. In our case 32 years. Big deal!We were sad, down, demotivated. I was desperately trying to cheer him up for sake of our upcoming trip to Bali. I tried to involve him in packing, planning anything and everything which requires human interaction. But he decided to stay in his shell and all I got was a cold response - ‘hmm’.After a point, I gave up. I quickly packed our bag and tried to focus on the Bali trip. The day proceeded with all sorts of disappointments. We both were slowly coming to this agreement that the Bali trip will be a disaster.Our cab arrived at around 8:30 pm and we started our journey for Netaji Subhas International Airport, Kolkata.Airport experiences are always the best. You get to see so many interesting people. There is one type of people who constantly eat. Then another type who constantly talk over phone. Then there are few people who constantly sneeze and cough spreading all kind of germs. And there are people like me who like to sip a cup of coffee and notice anything and everything around.This Air Asia flight had checked in baggage weight limit of 20kg. So, our packing was very basic like - Few sets of our clothes, light jewelries, a small makeup kit, toiletries, 2 sets of our shoes, few medicines, Umbrella etc. I was quite sure that our baggage weight is under 20 kg. But still I was skeptical until I saw a number 15.6 kg flashed on the weighing scale. I was relieved and at the same time got upset for not packing that beautiful Michael Kors bag and also that evening shoes or that embellished jacket of mine.Finally, our flight took off for Kuala Lumpur at around 01:00 Am Next Day.

The Air Asia flight experience was worst compared to our previous experiences of International flights. There was no entertainment unit, no food. (unless u buy one) with the package.We went through the menu and selected the safest option – Chicken Fried Rice. Mr. Husband always goes for this option whenever he gets confused with the menu. Because as per him “Chicken Fried Rice can never go wrong”.That half-cooked rice and almost raw chicken pieces certainly proved him WRONG!Me: “The amount they are taking for flight tickets, they should at least provide some decent food choices with it”.Mr. Husband: “Hmm…” [Munching sound]7: 25 AM (Malaysian Time) – We landed in Kuala Lumpur Airport. On that early morning, the airport was full of hustle and bustle. Big shops with International brands, bright lights, busy people everywhere. I was sleepy but desperately trying to look around.I asked him to get me some water. We found a Dunkin Donuts shop near the Gate and grab a water bottle. As we proceed to the billing counter we came to know, they only accept Malaysian Ringgit or US Dollars. We had small notes of $10. The water bottle was $1. But then they clearly stated they can’t give any changes for dollars. Now the situation was, to spend $10 we had to buy more food items which was impossible because we were full. We bought two bottles of water and got the change in Malaysian Ringgit which clearly had no use for us. 10:55 AM – Finally our flight took off to our dream destination – Bali.Upon reaching Bali we rushed to immigration and Baggage claim section. One by one everyone got their luggage and we were still waiting. As we were analyzing probable causes for the delay (like color of bag, early check in to Kolkata airport, Lazy people of Kolkata airport etc) we saw a golden ribbon tied to a blue vip coming down. Yes…that’s our bag. Me: Look that’s our bag. [Excited]Mr. Husband: Where? Where?Me: The one with the golden ribbon tied to the handle. The golden ribbon is from last year Diwali’s Mithai ka Dabba.(Sweet Box). [With a proud smile] 
Finally, we got our luggage. The next task was to get some IDR (Indonesian Rupiah). As he stood in the currency exchange queue, I looked around. So many people from various countries and cultures were there.I spotted few desis. Most of them were Honeymoon Couple. How did I know? Well, here’s how to spot a desi honeymoon couple -1.They will hold hands as if one of them will run away.2.The guy will be over-protective.3.The woman will act like she is as fragile as glass.4.Too much exposure of affection in public.       5.The guy considers himself a superman who will protect his lady from everyone.
And how do I know all these? We did the same 1 year back…By now everybody should know this was our 1st anniversary trip.
Mr. Husband: [Looked perplexed] They don’t exchange INR (Indian Rupees) here. Somebody told me such exchange counter will be outside of Airport terminal.We decided to find one on the way to our hotel.‘Mr. Samrra.. Mr Samrra’ .. A thin voice was reaching to us from the crowd.A middle aged guy with average physique and Asian features approached us. With a big, bright smile he told –“Mr, Samriah.. from Grand Inna Kuta”I was happy, finally our Bali trip is starting. He guided us to an Exchange counter outside airport terminal. My husband disappeared inside the exchange counter leaving me, our driver and the blue bag behind.To break the silence, I started the conversation with the most innovative and original way…Me: How’s the weather today in Bali?Driver: [With smile] aaa… It rain last week… Today no rain… good..good [thumbs up]Me: Ohkk… [I got the point… That’s what matters the most]Me: How long it will take to reach the hotel?Driver: Sorry?...Me: [Without trying hard] …Time to hotel?Driver: [Chuckled] Ohh now traffic…45 minutes to hotel…You from where?Me: IndiaDriver: Namaste…I know bollywood movies...I already knew this conversation can’t go longer than this. His broken English and my broken motivation was on fleek.“There he is…” …I saw my husband.Mr. Husband came back and assured me to explain the exchange rates, INR to IDR conversion, Dollar to IDR conversion once we reach hotel.It took us 30 minutes to reach our hotel – Grand Inna Kuta.The hotel is nearby the Kuta Beach. On the way, the glimpse of the Bali sea caught my eyes. I felt super excited…I wanted to see more.The Hotel reception area was huge with big pillars, shiny marble flooring, exotic sculptures, bright lights. Everything was adding a class to it.Here I tried to capture the hotel entrance and reception area.


A reception lady welcomed us with a wide smile. She explained everything very nicely. She informed us about a complimentary drink in their pool bar and also insisted us to join their grand pool party to celebrate one of their new restaurants inauguration.We took our keys and headed to the room assigned. A young guy guided the way towards our room. As we entered the room first thing I noticed was - two separate beds.I told myself: “Hmm ...Probably they do some thorough background checks of their guests. “Husband asked the guy to arrange a single King bed. He nodded his head and left.As the guy left… I looked out for the balcony and the sea view. To my disappointment, there was no balcony. Only a big glass window. As I opened the window and looked outside, I was amazed by the view. Husband stood behind me quietly.Me: I can see the sea clearly from here… And look so many people in the beach.Mr. Husband: Yah…Will go there today.For the first time, I saw a concealed excitement on his face.After the long 12 hours of journey we both were hungry. We ordered our favorite meal from the Kids meal section – Fried fish, French Fries and Fried Chicken. Someone has correctly said – “Food is the way to our soul”. …And that someone is ME!After finishing our
hefty lunch, I took a shower. I must say the housekeeping service is really
good in Grand Inna Kuta hotel. The bathroom
was neat and clean. Here is the list of items they provide in guest bathrooms –Freshly cleaned and bleached towelSoapShower GelShampooShower Cap and Hair tiesAfter bath body moisturizerToothpaste and ToothbrushAlso, every day they used
to change and replace all the items above. The housekeeping service is worth
mentioning here. They used to clean the room and bathroom really well. I was
really impressed.At around 6 pm we
headed towards Kuta Beach. On that way, we heard loud beats of party music.Me: That must be from the
Pool Party…[Kuta Beach: 6:15 pm] The sun was setting. A light breeze tousled
my hair. As I struggled tiding it up, he put his hand on my shoulder and
pointed his finger straight in front of us. We stood still and saw the
most amazing view that day. Those big waves were rolling upon the shore as if they
were surrendering their pride to nature. The cool breeze was so intoxicating. I
closed my eyes and tried to absorb the beauty of the moment as much as
possible.Trying hard to smile in this pic…On the way, back to our hotel we saw the pool party. Looked like lots of models and dancers were there to entertain the guests. Some guests were chilling beside the pool, some were dancing. We observed everything from a distance.We did some research on the places to visit in Bali beforehand. But we didn’t have any concrete plan. So, we decided to stop by the travel organizer counter inside the hotel lobby.A lady greeted us with a Namaste. We asked her about available tour packages in Bali. She handed over a booklet with all the packages and price written there. We went through all of them and had some discussion based on our googled knowledge of Bali and then decided a full Day tour package consisting Royal Temple, Secret Monkey forest, Tanah lot temple for tomorrow at 1 pm. The price was bit too high for us but who cares...Our Day 2 trip of Bali was all set.We ordered continental food which I had no idea whatsoever. My dish came with mashed potato and chicken breast. French fries were the life saver.. 😑We headed back to our room. The hotel was like a maze to me as we ended up losing our way. A housekeeping lady came forward to help us. The people we met so far were really nice to us. As we entered the room, the loud music was slowly fading away…
